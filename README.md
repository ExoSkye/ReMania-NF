# ReMania Nations Forever

An open source reimplementation of TrackMania Nations Forever. When completed it will be able to:
- Join online servers
- Use assets from the original game (will need to be copy/pasted across)
- Run on multiple platforms (Uses OpenGL and I'm trying to be as portable as possible)
- Be able to load tracks made for TMNF

It won't be able to:
- Login using a TrankMania account (I will add my own system for it)
